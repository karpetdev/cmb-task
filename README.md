Interview task for CMB.

### The task:
Create a Spring Boot application that will have one controller with a single GET method. Method should accept an optional query parameter and call two services in parallel.
First service should have a single method that returns String as a response with a possibility to set the value of the beforementioned String at runtime using the optional query parameter. Default value of the String should be injected from applicationâ€™s properties.
Second service should also have a single method returning String representation of the current date at UTC+1 in ISO 8601 format excl. time.
Controller method should then combine results of both services and return them to the caller as a custom response object with 2 attributes.
Integration should be covered by a JUnit test asserting that correct response is being returned after invocation of the controller method.

### Usage

GET - http://localhost:8080/home?queryParam=anyvalue

GET - http://localhost:8080/home
